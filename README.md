## Usage

This container is configured to look for the configuration files/database in `/usr/lib/unifi/data`.

UniFi/MongoDB log files are located in `/usr/lib/unifi/logs`

The most basic way to run this container is as follows:

```bash
$ docker run --name unifi -d -p 8080:8080 -p 8443:8443 -p 8880:8880 -p 8843:8843 \
	goofball222/unifi
```

This container exposes three volumes:
* /usr/lib/unifi/data - UniFi configuration data and DBs
* /usr/lib/unifi/logs - UniFi and MongoDB logs for troubleshooting
* /var/log/supervisor - supervisor process logs in the event of a failure

To have the container store the config/databases (recommended for persistence) 
and logs on your filesystem instead (recommended for troubleshooting!), run:

```bash
$ docker run --name unifi -d -p 8080:8080 -p 8443:8443 -p 8880:8880 -p 8843:8843 \
	-v /path/to/data:/usr/lib/unifi/data  \
	-v /path/to/logs:/usr/lib/unifi/logs \
	-v /path/to/supv/logs:/var/log/supervisor \
	goofball222/unifi
```

Use hosts networking stack
When you use docker switch `--net host`, the container will use the networking stack from the host itself. This means that you don't have to forward the ports and that the ports inside the container will be binded to the ones from the host. Big advantage is that any local devices (gateway, access points, etc) can broadcast to the controller software running as `--net host`.

```bash
docker run --net host --name unifi \
    -v /srv/services/unify-controller:/usr/lib/unifi/data \
    -v /srv/services/unify-controller:/usr/lib/unifi/logs \
    -v /srv/services/unify-controller:/var/log/supervisor \
    goofball222/unifi
```
